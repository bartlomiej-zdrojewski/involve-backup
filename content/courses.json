Every day, we need to make decisions about alternatives whose consequences cannot be predicted with certainty. Here are a few examples: You have saved 2000 dollars from your summer internship. Should you put it under your mattress, buy a Certificate of Deposit, Apple stock or an S&P 500 index fund? You manage a mutual fund specializing in technology stocks. Which proportion of the fund's total assets should you invest in each of the stocks recommended by your analysts? You work for a venture capital firm that wants to exit an investment. How can you compute the fair value the firm's share in the venture? In each of these situations, you need to commit resources (time, money, effort, etc.) in the face of uncertainty about the future. This course develops concepts and tools to address these types of situations. The focus is on basic principles and how they are applied in practice. No prior knowledge of finance required. A basic preparation in mathematics (probability, statistics, and optimization) is desirable; however many technical concepts and tools will be developed or reviewed in the course. The course is appropriate for engineering or science students wishing to apply their quantitative skills to develop a basic understanding of financial modeling and markets. This is a 10 week course. There will be several short (5-30 minutes) lectures each week. Challenges covering the lecture material will be given each week. There will also be two projects that involve real financial data. Solutions will be posted online. Submissions will be evaluated by fellow participants.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant. Three features of the new system are central. Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse. Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective. Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.","level":"2","type":"Wideo/zadania","source":"Columbia"},{"title":"Wpływ banków na świat","link":"https://www.edx.org/course/just-money-banking-if-society-mattered-mitx-11-405x","description":"What you'll learn The core principles of just banking How finance can be used as a tool for social and environmental change Ongoing challenges for just banks Connect with a global community of learners and change-makers","level":"2","type":"Wideo/zadania","source":"MIT"},{"title":"Zarządzanie ryzykiem","link":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/risk-management?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","description":"What is risk?

Understand financial investments and the associated risks With experts from the Centre for Financial and Management Studies at SOAS University of London, you’ll look at practical examples of financial investments, to examine: the main functions of finance and of risk management the main forms of financial investment, such as stocks and bonds, derivatives, futures and options, hedging and speculation strategies how firms hedge risk by using financial derivatives how risk management is applied in the financial and in the non-financial sector. Learn how the financial crisis and emerging markets are changing risk management The course will explore how finance has changed in recent years, and ask if these changes have resulted in greater systemic risk for the financial sector and for the economy as a whole. By examining concepts such as behavioural finance, we’ll ask if inappropriate risk management has exacerbated the recent financial crisis. Finally, we’ll turn our attention to new and emerging markets. For example, how is risk managed in Islamic finance? How might common tools alter risk in investment positions in mature markets as well as in the banking sector? And how can firms utilise risk management tools most effectively? By the end of the four-week course, you’ll be able to: understand financial markets and the principles of risk management understand the main types of risk and evaluate the methods and tools used by firms to manage risks examine ideas and methods used in the analysis of portfolios of financial securities, including stocks and bonds explain the use of financial derivatives for hedging (reducing risk) and speculation (increasing risk) in financial markets evaluate the application of risk methods and risk management tools in the global economy","level":"2","type":"Wideo/zadania","source":"SOAS University of London"}],"Giełda":[{"title":"Stocks and Bonds: Risks and Returns","link":"https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/GSB/StocksBonds/SelfPaced/about","description":"Stocks and bonds have always been a critical part of any investment portfolio, but what do investors actually get in exchange for their investment?

The ancient gods of Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths still exist, but today, they have superpowers, human foibles and secret identities. They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation. From Superman® and Spider-Man®, to The Avengers® and The Hulk® and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions? Learn from Smithsonian and industry experts including: Stan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man®, The Hulk, Thor®, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron. Michael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego® Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman® VS Superman. In this self-paced course, we explore the following questions: Why did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their “Golden Age” during World War II? Why did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades? How have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930’s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices? Why was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950’s? How did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century? When and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools? When and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz? Finally, when and how did comic books become “cool” and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe? The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today’s world. As you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero– or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes.

Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

What is the accuracy of a GPS position measurement? How fast should an airplane travel to minimize fuel consumption? The answers to all of these questions involve the derivative. But what is the derivative? You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative. You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions. You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior. You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.","level":"2","type":"Wideo/zadania","source":"MIT"},{"title":"Calculus 1B Integration","link":"https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1b-integration-mitx-18-01-2x","description":"How long should the handle of your spoon be so that your fingers do not burn while mixing chocolate fondue?

You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative. You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics.

Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.","level":"2","type":"Wideo/zadania","source":"MIT"}],"Chemia":[{"title":"Chemistry","link":"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry","description":"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry","level":"1","type":"Interaktywny kurs","source":"Khan Academy"},{"title":"Chemistry 1","link":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/chemistry-1?siteID=SAyYsTvLiGQ-I0PWly6730CwHWAbfyE4uA&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=SAyYsTvLiGQ","description":"This course is designed to cover subjects in advanced high school chemistry courses, correlating to the standard topics as established by the American Chemical Society.

Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?
